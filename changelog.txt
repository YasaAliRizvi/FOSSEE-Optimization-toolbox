Version 0.4.1 (July 1, 2021)
  HessianApproximation option has been added in fot_fmincon to allow the user to choose the method of calculating the hessian -- "exact" hessian approximation which uses second derivatives provided by the NLP or "limited-memory" hessian approximation which performs a limited-memory quasi-Newton approximation.
  Integer constraints in the fot_intlinprog function are now working correctly.
  The MPS file can now be passed to the function fot_intlinprog without throwing any error.
  Bugs have been fixed in fot_lsqnonlin.
  The content in the help files have been modified to improve correctness.
  Errors have been removed from examples in various help files to ensure that they run correctly and give the expected results.
